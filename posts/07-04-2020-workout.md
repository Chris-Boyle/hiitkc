We got challenged to do this one by a friend for the Fourth of July.  
We started on different exercises but our result was very similar... sore for 3-4 days after.
In honor of our countries birthday we did:

- 7 exercises for the seventh month of the year
- 4 burpees between each exercise for the fourth day of the month
- 76 reps of the 7 exercises for the year our country was born 1776

#### Movements

- Push-ups
- Jumping jacks
- Air squats
- Shoulder taps
- Crunches (or other ab exercise)
- Lunges
- Mountain climbers
